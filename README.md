My first fully fleshed project that I am making for genuine personal use, rather than as a 'side boring project'.
Code exists to solve problems, and my role as a software engineer is to come up with solutions to solve these problems. This project aimed at solving my own problems
with not logging my workouts, or not wanting to copy and paste previous weeks of a spreadsheet to copy over. This is a solution that I use 6 out of the 7 days of the week.
